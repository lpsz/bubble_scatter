# BubbleScatter

Bubble Scatter is a visualization tool that allows you to put four dimensions on a two-dimensional chart.

![Example](demo.png?raw=true)

In this figure we see housing prices versus the number of rooms.

Additionally, bubble sizes demonstrate conditional distribution (price distribution for each value of the number of rooms)

Bubble colors show a percentage of lower population status (red is greater, blue is lower).
